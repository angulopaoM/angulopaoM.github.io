                <pre id = "answers">
                    Amongst all CMSC courses I have taken so far, I am most fond of CMSC 12 since it 
                    is the first ever CMSC course that I took and is what pushed me to complete my shifting
                    to BS Computer Science. Taking up CMSC 12 made me realize that I really love the course
                    and take it up as my future career.

                <h4 id = "main-questions">Favorite GE Course so Far and Why:</h4>
                <pre id = "answers">
                    For my favorite GE Course taken so far, it would be ETHICS 1 mainly because
                    of how much I was able to learn about life through the course. A big part of
                    why it is my favorite GE is also because of how great my instructor was in teaching
                    his students, always assuring that he puts the well-being of his students above all
                    else.

                <pre id = "answers">
                    since python is the first programming language
                    that learned, and is what I think the most user-friendly and practical
                    language to use out of the few languages that I have experienced learning.
                    Furthermore, I sincerely believe that I would most probably use the language
                    in the future.
